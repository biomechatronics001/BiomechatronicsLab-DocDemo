Welcome to Test's documentation!
===================================

This is a demo page to show how to use Readthedocs to automatically generate documentation website based on your **python** code. Other code such as *Arduino*, *C++* should also be supported but needs to be tested.

Readthedocs automatically pulls docstring from your code file. Some useful tutorials can be found `here <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html>`, `here <https://pythonforthelab.com/blog/documenting-with-sphinx-and-readthedocs/>`, and `here <https://amazonwebshark.com/open-source-documentation-with-read-the-docs/>`.

This demonstrates the page reference function: :doc:`factorial` and :doc:`people`. 

More details to be added.
